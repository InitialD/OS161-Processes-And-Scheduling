Task 1: Complete  
The test 'p testbin/argtest 123 abc' returns the expected output as per  
the discussion board post. All that is required is pushing enter when the  
test is run to exit.  
  
Task 2: Complete  
The test wt returns as expected. I will push soon to repo.  

Task 3: Complete  
The test 'p testbin/killtest' returns as expected. I will push soon to repo.  
Sometimes failes due to stray interrupt. Need fixing.
