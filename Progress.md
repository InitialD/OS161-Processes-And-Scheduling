Task 1: Complete  
The test 'p testbin/argtest 123 abc' returns the expected output as per  
the discussion board post. All that is required is pushing enter when the  
test is run to exit.  
  
Task 2: In Progress  
Implementation will not allow test to finish. Needs debugging and testing.  
Test will start but not finish. (SSH issue?)

Task 3: In Progress  
Implementation will not allow test to finish. Also on lines 170-175 of  
trap.c, we get an issue for pi_cv_stop since it is not part of thread. I'm not  
sure how to fix this. It is commented out currently.
